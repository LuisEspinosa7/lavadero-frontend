# Lavadero's Management System - Vehicles Washing FRONTEND

Lavadero is a web app and the general idea was to create a web app to allow the app's owner to connect vehicle washing establishments 
and its workers, this is like a new business model in Colombia, quite new indeed. The app's owner (admin from now on) was gonna 
receive a small tip or commision for the app's usage. The admin had to configure the platform when new establishments (business owners) 
joined in, this configuration includes everything inside the establishment. The operators (business manager) had to use the app inside 
the establishment, creating new service's orders and pay the workers through a ticket generated for each one. Finally the admin, 
the establishment owner and operators could access historical lists and reports.

It was developed by Luis Espinosa Llanos and for the frontend it was used the following technologies and tools:  

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>
  	Core	
    </td>
    <td>
  	HTML, CSS 3+, Angular 8.3.6, Angular Material, TypeScript.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
  	Server	
    </td>
    <td>
  	Development server
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

It was written using the best practices for instance, a component oriented approach, and more...
